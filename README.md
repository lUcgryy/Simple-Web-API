# Simple Web API
 
This is a simple shopping web API that inherits most of the functionality from my previous project, [Simple Web](https://github.com/lUcgryy/Simple-Web). It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It is also containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

Use `docker-compose up --build` to build and run the application. Visit `https://localhost:3443` to see the application in action.
To stop the application, use `docker-compose down`.

For API documentation, visit `https://localhost:3443/api-docs`.
